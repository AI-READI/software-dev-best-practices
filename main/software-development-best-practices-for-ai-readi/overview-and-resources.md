# Overview and resources
Our best practices are designed to A) Comply with the [FAIR4RS principles](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x), B) Promote open-source practices, C) Facilitate collaborations and inclusivity (aligning with inclusive development and innovation which are part of the [CARE principles](https://www.gida-global.org/care)), and D) Provide convenience to developers. The rationale for such a design is provided in Section D of this document. For each element of the best practices, we indicate which of the categories A-D they fulfill. Moreover, our best practices are based on the resources listed below. These resources were selected based on the authors’ knowledge of their relevance to the categories A-D. For each element of the best practices, we indicate which resources it is based on.
