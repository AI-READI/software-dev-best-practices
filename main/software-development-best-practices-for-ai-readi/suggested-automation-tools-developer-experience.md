# 7. Suggested automation tools/Developer experience

In this section, we provide suggestions for automated tools and approaches to fulfilling some of the items from sections 1-6. These are purely suggestions and developers are free to follow other approaches as long as they fulfill all the items from sections 1-6.

* 7.1. A [template repository](https://github.com/AI-READI/template) is available where some of the best practices requirements are pre-implemented. You can use this template to start your GitHub repository for the AI-READI project.
* 7.2. Unless you have a preferred code editor, use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for developing your code and include the `.vscode` directory in your GitHub repository.
* 7.3. Use these VS Code extensions (or their equivalent in your preferred code editor) as applicable to your project to automatically implement some elements of the best practices: [Category: D] [Ref: [1](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-1)]
   * 7.3.1. [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments): Help you create more human-friendly comments and visualize them in your code.
   * 7.3.2. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Integrates ESLint code formatting into VS Code for Javascript projects.
   * 7.3.3. [Isort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort): A Visual Studio Code extension that provides import sorting for Python using isort.
   * 7.3.4. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Code formatter: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
   * 7.3.5. [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin): A TypeScript server plugin to make the TypeScript server know `*.vue` files.
* 7.4. Use an appropriate linter for additional code quality checks before pushing a commit (eg: [Flake](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)/[Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) for Python, [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)/[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for Javascript, etc.)
* 7.5. When adding automated testing to your application try to use the following testing frameworks if possible:
   * 7.5.1. Javascript:
     * 7.5.1.1. Unit/Integration - [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)/[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
     * 7.5.1.2. End-to-end - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
   * 7.5.2. Python:
     * 7.5.1.3. Unit/Integration - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/)
* 7.6. Use [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate tasks such as fixing grammatical errors, formatting code, managing GitHub issue submission, stale issues, and PRs, running unit/integration or end-to-end tests, building and releasing app/api/documentation versions on GitHub and Zenodo. Include GitHub action workflows in a `.github/workflows` folder in your repository. Standard workflow files are maintained for the AI-READI project in the `github-workflows` repository and can be copied into your software repository.

* 7.7. Use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for any web/Node.js applications instead of JavaScript where possible. TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that extends JavaScript, for a better developer experience and more fault-tolerant applications. [Category: D] [Ref: [1](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-1)]
* 7.8. Use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for developing and maintaining simple hostable development and/or user documentation [Category: D] [Ref:[1](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-1)]
* 7.9. Use [FAIRshare](https://docs.fairshareapp.io/docs/intro) to create metadata files easily, make GitHub releases, share software files on Zenodo, and register the software on bio.tools [Category: D] [Ref: [1-2](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-1)]
* 7.10. Mirror repository on GitLab for backup. The AI-READI organization has GitLab sync automatically set up so no further actions are required [Category: D] [Ref: [1](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-1)]
