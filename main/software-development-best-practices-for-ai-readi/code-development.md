# 2. Code development

* 2.1. Follow language-specific standards and conventions when writing your code [Category: A, C] [Ref: 1, 2, 10-12]
   * 2.1.1. Python: [Python Developer's Guide](https://devguide.python.org/)
   * 2.1.2. R: [Google's R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html)
   * 2.1.3. Java: [Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
* 2.2. Use an appropriate linter for automated code quality improvements and formatting fixes (c.f. section 7)
* 2.3. Give functions and variables meaningful names [Category: C] [Ref: [3](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-3), [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-4)]
* 2.4. Include comments within your code when deemed necessary for reuse. These comments need to be added using already accepted standards or conventions (e.g: [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for JavaScript, [Google style guide for docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for Python code) [Category: A, C] [Ref: [1](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-1),[2](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-2), [3](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-3), [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-4), [6](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-6), [10-12](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-10)]
* 2.5. If using external libraries, favor well-maintained software libraries and make sure their license is compatible with your software license [Category: C] [Ref: [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-4), [7](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-7), [21](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-21)]
* 2.6. Record software dependencies in a requirements.txt or similar file [Category: A, C] [Ref: [2](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-2), [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-4)]
* 2.7. Add appropriate tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to all modules in your application. Try to achieve high coverage to ensure that future developments do not cause accidental regressions in your application. Continuous Integration can/should? be set up to handle automated testing between all developers in the team. Cross-browser accessibility can be handled by the end-to-end test runner [Category: B, D] [Ref: [3](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-3), [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-4), [11](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-11)]
* 2.8. Identify and utilize tools to benchmark for accessibility such as Accessibility Insights for Web development etc. [Category: C] [Ref: [18-19](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#user-content-18)]
* 2.9. Web-based software should support Modern Browsers developed with the Webkit, Blink, or Gecko rendering engines (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, MS Edge). Uncertainties around specific support for recent HTML/CSS/JavaScript features may be resolved via the CanIUse database (https://caniuse.com/). Testing of front-end layout rendering and cross-browser consistency can be performed via browser-specific development tools (e.g. Firebug, Chromium developer tools) or virtualization (e.g. https://www.browserstack.com/) if available.
