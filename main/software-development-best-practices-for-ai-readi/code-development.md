* 2.3. Give functions and variables meaningful names [Category: C] [Ref: [3](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B3%5D%20General%20guidelines%20for%20biomedical%20software%20development%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.12688%252Ff1000research.10750.2), [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B4%5D%20Good%20enough%20practices%20in%20scientific%20computing%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)]
* 2.4. Include comments within your code when deemed necessary for reuse. These comments need to be added using already accepted standards or conventions (e.g: [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) for JavaScript, [Google style guide for docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for Python code) [Category: A, C] [Ref: [1](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B1%5D%20AI%2DREADI%20team%20members%E2%80%99%20knowledge%20and%20experience),[2](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B2%5D%20Making%20Biomedical%20Research%20Software%20FAIR%3A%20Actionable%20Step%2Dby%2Dstep%20Guidelines%20with%20a%20User%2Dsupport%20Tool%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.18.488694), [3](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B3%5D%20General%20guidelines%20for%20biomedical%20software%20development%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.12688%252Ff1000research.10750.2), [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B4%5D%20Good%20enough%20practices%20in%20scientific%20computing%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510), [6](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B6%5D%20Ten%20simple%20rules%20for%20documenting%20scientific%20software%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006561), [10-12](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B10%5D%20Elixir%20software%20management%20plan%20template%20https%3A//elixir%2Deurope.org/sites/default/files/documents/software%2Dmanagement%2Dplan.pdf)]
* 2.5. If using external libraries, favor well-maintained software libraries and make sure their license is compatible with your software license [Category: C] [Ref: [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B4%5D%20Good%20enough%20practices%20in%20scientific%20computing%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510), [7](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B7%5D%204%20Simple%20recommendations%20for%20Open%20Source%20Software%20https%3A//softdev4research.github.io/4OSS%2Dlesson/01%2Dintroduction/index.html), [21](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B21%5D%20License%20Compatibility%20and%20Relicensing%20https%3A//www.gnu.org/licenses/license%2Dcompatibility.html)]
* 2.6. Record software dependencies in a requirements.txt or similar file [Category: A, C] [Ref: [2](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B2%5D%20Making%20Biomedical%20Research%20Software%20FAIR%3A%20Actionable%20Step%2Dby%2Dstep%20Guidelines%20with%20a%20User%2Dsupport%20Tool%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.18.488694), [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B4%5D%20Good%20enough%20practices%20in%20scientific%20computing%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)]
* 2.7. Add appropriate tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) to all modules in your application. Try to achieve high coverage to ensure that future developments do not cause accidental regressions in your application. Continuous Integration can/should? be set up to handle automated testing between all developers in the team. Cross-browser accessibility can be handled by the end-to-end test runner [Category: B, D] [Ref: [3](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B3%5D%20General%20guidelines%20for%20biomedical%20software%20development%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.12688%252Ff1000research.10750.2), [4](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B4%5D%20Good%20enough%20practices%20in%20scientific%20computing%2C%20https%3A//doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510), [11](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B11%5D%20Top%2010%20metrics%20for%20life%20science%20software%20good%20practices%20%5Bversion%201%3B%20peer%20review%3A%202%20approved%5D%20https%3A//f1000research.com/articles/5%2D2000/v1)]
* 2.8. Identify and utilize tools to benchmark for accessibility such as Accessibility Insights for Web development etc. [Category: C] [Ref: [18-19](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-development-best-practices/blob/code-development/main/software-development-best-practices-for-ai-readi/overview-and-resources.md#:~:text=%5B18%5D%20Web%20accessibility%20in%20mind%20https%3A//webaim.org/)]
* 2.9. Web-based software should support Modern Browsers developed with the Webkit, Blink, or Gecko rendering engines (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Firefox, MS Edge). Uncertainties around specific support for recent HTML/CSS/JavaScript features may be resolved via the CanIUse database (https://caniuse.com/). Testing of front-end layout rendering and cross-browser consistency can be performed via browser-specific development tools (e.g. Firebug, Chromium developer tools) or virtualization (e.g. https://www.browserstack.com/) if available.
