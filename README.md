# Software Development Best Practices of the AI-READI Project

## About
This repository is meant to share and maintain the software development best practices of the AI-READI project. The rationales for establishing these best practices are to:
- Help the standardization of the AI-READI software to facilitate future reuse, i.e. make the AI-READI software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)
- Ensure the efficient and effective development of software across the project, especially when contributions from several teams are required
- Facilitate on-boarding of new developers to the project

Our focus here is on establishing actionable best practices that can be directly implemented by developers of the project. These best practices are intended to remain general enough such that they can apply to any software development project within AI-READI.

This repository is also meant to collect feedback/suggestions (through the GitHub issues) such that we can improve our guidelines and/or align them with external teams (e.g., other teams from the Bridge2AI consortium).

## Current version of the practices
The latest version of the best practices are available [here]() in this repository. They can also be accesses through [Zenodo]() or viewed conveniently on [dev.aireadi.org](http://dev.aireadi.org).

## Repository structure
Each version of the best practices are stored in a dedicated folder under the `versions` folder. Each version include:
1. The best practices, provided in markdown format (one file per section of the best practices).
2. The rationale behind the different elements of the best practices, provided in markdown format.
3. The approach for monitoring the implementation of the best practices in the project.
4. A pdf file combining all of the above.

Changes between the different versions are tracked in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/fairdataihub/FAIR-BioRS-guidelines/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) file. 

## Feedback and contribution
Use the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AI-READI/software-dev-best-practices/issues) for submitting feedback or making suggestions. You can also fork the repository and submit a pull request with suggestions. Suggestions will be reviewed and approved by the AI-READI Tools module PIs (with inclusion of other team members as deemed necessary). 

## Version release
A GitHub release is created for each new version of the best practices. The pdf version of the best practice document is archived on Zenodo with each release such that each version of the best practices can be referenced with a unique digital object identifier (DOI). Additionally, the latest version of best practices will be visible on [dev.aireadi.org](http://dev.aireadi.org), the developer documentation website for the AI-READI project. This documentation will display the best practices in a user-friendly manner and will contain additional elements (e.g., code snippets) such that the best practices can be easily implemented by developers.
