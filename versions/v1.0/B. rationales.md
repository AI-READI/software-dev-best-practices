# Rationales

We provide below the rationales behind the design of our best practices.

## Comply with the FAIR4RS principles

The Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) Principles published in 2016 provide a framework for optimizing the reuse of all digital research objects, including research software. They are widely accepted by all research fields (7.5k+ citations) and are a key aspect of the Bridge2AI program. Our best practices thus include elements for making all research software developed in the AI-READI project FAIR. While postulated for all digital research objects, several research groups have shown that the FAIR principles as written do not directly apply to software because they do not capture the specific traits of research software. To address this shortcoming, the FAIR for Research Software (FAIR4RS) Working Group of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) established in 2021 reformulated FAIR principles tailored for research software called the FAIR4RS principles. Just like the original FAIR principles, the FAIR4RS principles are aspirational and aimed at providing a general framework. Our team has established actionable guidelines called the FAIR-BioRS guidelines for making biomedical research software compliant with the FAIR4RS principles. Our software development best practices are designed based on these FAIR-BioRS guidelines.

## Promote open-source practices

FAIR is not equal to Open: the "A" in FAIR stands for "Accessible under well-defined conditions", not "Accessible to all without restrictions". In the AI-READI project, we will aim to promote open-source development practices to facilitate the reuse of our software further and encourage external contributions. Our best practices thus include elements for promoting open source practices in all software developed in the AI-READI project. These elements are based mainly on relevant literature such as the "General guidelines for biomedical software development", the "Good enough practices in scientific computing", NIH's "Best Practices for Sharing Research Software ", and the "Ten simple rules for documenting scientific software".

## Facilitate collaborations and inclusivity

Since we expect software to typically involve multiple developers and stakeholders/communities, our best practices include elements to facilitate collaborations. These elements are based on the AI-READI team members' knowledge and experience, as well as relevant literature such as the "General guidelines for biomedical software development", "Good enough practices in scientific computing", aspects of the CARE principles (which are relevant not only to data but also software), published studies on community engagement in software development etc.
Provide convenience to developers
We recognize that implementing some of the elements suggested in our best practices could be time-consuming for developers. Our best practices thus include elements for developers to conveniently and efficiently implement these elements. These elements are based mainly on the AI-READI team members' knowledge and experience. For example, wherever possible, boilerplate and partially completed template files will be provided for configuration, documentation, meta-data and other support files to decrease the time and effort necessary to meet these requirements.
