# Monitoring compliance with the best practices

Compliance with these best practices will be self monitored by the developers of each code project. Each repository will be required to include the following self-assessment file at the root folder of the repository. This file will have to be updated progressively as the developers comply with the various items of the best practices. Anyone could then quickly assess compliance and open a GitHub issue or pull request if any anomalies are detected.
